# KeepInTouch PHP

A rudimentary web application written in PHP that emulates a blogging platform, based on the MVC design pattern.  Created as a final project for [Harvard's CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x).

## Features

* A user login system that allows for registering new users, logging in as a previous user, and logging out.
* Registered users can author blog posts visible to all other users.
* Registered users have their own 'home page' listing off all of their previously-made posts.

## Uses

* The MySQLi extension for PHP for database tasks.
* [Bootstrap CSS](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/) for basic page styling.

## Status

**Currently unfinished.**

Future tasks:
* Reformat timestamps.
* Additional error-checking in some areas.
